I have craeted a Public repo 'github' in my github server; 

https://github.com/REWATSING/github.git

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created a local directory 'github2'and created file 'readme.txt', which i have add, commit and push to remore branch origin/main or we can create new branch after adding remote repo. use credentials, brwserlogin or code gernerated to login remote server;

modified local file and made a update-1 commit and push;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now i have edited this file on github itself and are going to pull into local and then push with the next update-2 commit.
