The error you're seeing indicates that the branch `uat` does not have an upstream (remote) branch associated with it. This happens when you've created a new branch locally but haven't told Git where to push the changes on the remote repository (like GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

To resolve this, you can use the command suggested in the error message:

### Solution:
1. **Set the upstream branch** and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin uat
   ```

   This command does two things:
   - **Pushes the `uat` branch** to the remote repository (to the `origin` remote).
   - **Sets the upstream branch**, meaning it links your local `uat` branch with the remote `uat` branch, so in the future you can just run `git push` without needing extra options.

### Explanation:
- **Upstream Branch:** An upstream branch is the remote branch that your local branch is tracking. Once the upstream is set, Git knows where to push and pull from.
- **Origin:** This is the default name for the remote repository when you clone it.

Once you run this command, future `git push` commands will work smoothly without needing the `--set-upstream` option, as your `uat` branch will be linked to the remote branch.

### Automatic Setup for Future Branches (Optional):
If you want Git to automatically set the upstream branch for all new branches, you can configure Git with the following command:
```bash
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true
```
This way, Git will automatically set the upstream when pushing new branches.
