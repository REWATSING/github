Why Is Interactive Rebase Important?
Cleaning Up History: It allows you to clean up your commit history by squashing multiple small commits into one, reordering commits, or removing unwanted commits. This makes the project history easier to read and review.

Rewriting Commits: You can fix typos or errors in commit messages, or even modify commits themselves before pushing to a shared repository.

Team Collaboration: Especially in teams, having a clean and understandable history helps collaborators understand the project's evolution without getting bogged down in unnecessary or redundant commits.

Common Use Case:
Suppose you realize that the "More changes" commit was just a small follow-up to "Added new content," and you'd prefer to have just one commit representing both changes. You'd use git rebase -i to squash them into a single commit.

After completing the rebase process, your history would contain just one clean commit, which might look like this:

sql
Copy code
commit abcdef12
Author: You <you@example.com>
Date:   Mon Sep 9 2024

    Added new content and made more changes
This makes your commit history more concise and readable.
